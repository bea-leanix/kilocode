# Using SAP AI Core With Kilo Code

Kilo Code supports accessing models through SAP AI Core, a service in the SAP Business Technology Platform that lets you efficiently run AI scenarios in a standardized, scalable, and hyperscaler-agnostic manner.

**Website:** [https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core)

## Prerequisites

- **SAP BTP Account:** You need an active SAP Business Technology Platform account.
- **SAP AI Core Service:** You must have access to the SAP AI Core service in your BTP subaccount.
- **Service Instance:** Create a service instance of SAP AI Core with appropriate service plan.
- **Service Key:** Generate a service key for your SAP AI Core service instance to obtain the required credentials.

## Getting Credentials

To use SAP AI Core with Kilo Code, you'll need to create a service key for your SAP AI Core service instance:

1. **In SAP BTP Cockpit:**

    - Navigate to your subaccount
    - Go to "Services" â†’ "Instances and Subscriptions"
    - Find your SAP AI Core service instance
    - Create a new service key

2. **Service Key Information:**
   The service key will contain the following information you'll need:
    - **Client ID:** OAuth2 client identifier
    - **Client Secret:** OAuth2 client secret
    - **Auth URL:** OAuth2 authentication endpoint
    - **Base URL:** SAP AI Core API base URL
    - **Resource Group:** (Optional) Specify a resource group, defaults to "default"

## Operating Modes

SAP AI Core provider supports two operating modes:

### Foundation Models Mode (Default)

- Uses foundation models that require active deployments
- Currently, supports **OpenAI models only** due to SAP AI Core SDK limitations
- Requires you to have running deployments for the models you want to use
- Models must have deployments in "RUNNING" status to be selectable

### Orchestration Mode

- Uses SAP AI Core's orchestration capabilities
- Supports models from multiple providers: **Amazon, Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Mistral AI**
- Does not require separate deployments
- Provides access to a broader range of models

## Model Requirements

Kilo Code applies the following filters when fetching models:

- **Streaming:** Models must support streaming
- **Capabilities:** Models must support text generation
- **Context Window:** Models must have a context window of at least 32,000 tokens

## Supported Providers

### Foundation Models Mode

- **OpenAI:** All OpenAI models with active deployments

### Orchestration Mode

- **Amazon:** Amazon foundation models
- **Anthropic:** Claude models
- **Google:** Gemini models
- **OpenAI:** ChatGPT and GPT models
- **Mistral AI:** Mistral AI models

The exact list of available models depends on your SAP AI Core configuration and active model offerings.

## Configuration in Kilo Code

1. **Open Kilo Code Settings:** Click the gear icon (<Codicon name="gear" />) in the Kilo Code panel.
2. **Select Provider:** Choose "SAP AI Core" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3. **Enter Credentials:**
    - **Client ID:** Enter your SAP AI Core OAuth2 client ID
    - **Client Secret:** Enter your SAP AI Core OAuth2 client secret
    - **Base URL:** Enter your SAP AI Core API base URL (e.g., `https://api.ai.ml.hana.ondemand.com`)
    - **Auth URL:** Enter your SAP AI Core OAuth2 auth URL (e.g., `https://your-subdomain.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com`)
    - **Resource Group:** (Optional) Enter your resource group name, defaults to "default"
4. **Choose Operating Mode:**
    - **Orchestration Mode:** Check the "Use Orchestration" checkbox for broader model access
    - **Foundation Models Mode:** Leave unchecked to use foundation models with deployments
5. **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the dropdown
6. **Select Deployment:** (Foundation Models Mode only) Choose an active deployment for your selected model

## Deployments (Foundation Models Mode)

When using Foundation Models mode:

- You must have active deployments for the models you want to use
- Only deployments with "RUNNING" status are available for selection
- Deployments in other states (PENDING, STOPPED, etc.) are shown but disabled
- The interface displays the number of available deployments for each model

## Tips and Notes

- **Authentication:** SAP AI Core uses OAuth2 client credentials flow for authentication
- **Caching:** Model and deployment information is cached for 15 and 5 minutes respectively to improve performance
- **Resource Groups:** If you use multiple resource groups, specify the appropriate one in the configuration
- **Permissions:** Ensure your service key has the necessary permissions to access models and deployments
- **Orchestration Benefits:** Use Orchestration mode for access to a wider variety of models without managing deployments
- **Foundation Models Benefits:** Use Foundation Models mode when you need more control over specific model deployments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures:**

    - Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
    - Check that your Auth URL is properly formatted
    - Ensure your service key hasn't expired

2. **No Models Available:**

    - Check that you have the necessary permissions in your resource group
    - Verify your Base URL is correct
    - In Foundation Models mode, ensure you have running deployments

3. **Deployment Issues:**

    - Check that your deployments are in "RUNNING" status
    - Verify you're using the correct resource group
    - Review your SAP AI Core service configuration

4. **Model Access:**
    - In Foundation Models mode, **only OpenAI models** are currently supported
    - Switch to Orchestration mode for access to other providers
    - Ensure models meet the minimum requirements (32k context window, streaming support)

## Getting Started

To get started with SAP AI Core:

1. Set up your SAP BTP account and access SAP AI Core service
2. Create a service instance and generate a service key
3. Configure Kilo Code with your credentials
4. Choose between Foundation Models or Orchestration mode based on your needs
5. Select an appropriate model and start coding
